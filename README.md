## About This Project
This is single page Restaurant Homepage, which uses tabbed browsing to access the Contact and Menu pages, in which almost no [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) is used all contents of the website are generated by [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). And this is first project I am using [package bundler (webpack)](https://webpack.js.org/).
